Random forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and merges them to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Each tree is trained on a random subset of data and features, and during prediction, the final output is determined by aggregating the predictions of all trees, typically through majority voting for classification or averaging for regression. This method increases robustness, handles high-dimensional data, reduces variance, and is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees, making it a powerful and widely used algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. Random Forest algorithm uses the method of dividing the set of data in random subsets and creating a decision tree for each random subset. Further all the random decision tress are aggregated to predict the result which reduces risk of overfitting and thus improves the performance. Random Forest reduces complexities in handing large data sets. Random Forest ensembles decision trees and during training each tree focuses on a particular random subset only, and in the end each tree casts into own votes where for classification, mode across the trees is used and for regression it calculates the average prediction from each tree. n prediction, the algorithm aggregates the results of all trees, either by voting (for classification tasks) or by averaging (for regression tasks) This collaborative decision-making process, supported by multiple trees with their insights, provides an example stable and precise results. Random forests are widely used for classification and regression functions, which are known for their ability to handle complex data, reduce overfitting, and provide reliable forecasts in different environments.
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm in machine learning used for problems based on binary classified target which means it’s for accurate when the output variable is categorical and binary. It is easy to implement but it’s performance can be limited for complex or non-linear data. It works by estimating the probability of if a given input belongs to a particular class. For this purpose, it uses a sigmoid function to a linear combination of input features. This sigmoid function then converts the output to a value between 0 and 1. 
Ridge classification is a type of classification that uses ridge regression (also known as Tikhonov normalization) for classification problems. It is particularly useful when relevant features are available or when the dataset is susceptible to overfitting.Ridge classifier: Ridge classification is usually based on a linear model, which means that it tries to separate classes by finding a linear decision boundary model. Ridge Regression: The ridge regression adds a penalty proportional to the square of the model coefficients (weights). This penalty period helps prevent the model coefficients from becoming too large and reduces the risk of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when our model works excellently on the trained data but poorly on the test data or the data on which prediction is to be made.
K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is a supervised machine learning model based method that is used to find the solutions for regression and classification problems. KNN is beneficial for solving pattern based problems and extracting information for making predictions from the given training data.
